# DESIGN_TODO

Paths: CORE = rust/crates/dcpwizard-core/src, CLI = rust/crates/dcpwizard-cli/src/main.rs,
PK = extern/postkit (postkit submodule, pinned at be89fe0; bump the pin when postkit changes).
DoM refs (dom#N = https://dcpomatic.com/bugs/view.php?id=N) are DCP-o-matic tracker
feature requests. Shared DSP/parsers belong in postkit (see its DESIGN_TODO); the
user-facing surface is here.

## Open

- Distributed encoding across machines (dom#155, dom#1635, dom#2605). Out of scope
  (user-excluded). The job queue is single-machine and its create path wraps
  pre-encoded J2K rather than running postkit::pipeline, so job progress is
  stage-based, not per-frame.
- Interop KDM (`kdm --format interop`) is legacy and unvalidated: no reference
  library generates Interop (libdcp only reads it) and the suite has no reference
  Interop KDM to diff against. Validate against real legacy gear before production.
  No Trusted Device List / DeviceList is written for any KDM.
- conform input formats: only CMX3600 EDL and FCP7 xmeml parse. AAF errors as
  not-implemented, OTIO and FCPX (fcpxml) are rejected as unsupported.
- Trailer accessibility check is still substring matching, not a real track probe.
- GUI `--hdr-dci` is skipped: the job queue encodes through
  postkit::pipeline::run_encode_with_ratio -> stream_encode, which hardcodes
  apply_xyz_transform=true and has no HDR-to-DCI LUT / PQ-passthrough branch or
  per-codestream cap. Authoring an HDR DCP there would mislabel XYZ-transformed
  frames as ST 2084 PQ, so it stays CLI-only (grok path). Other CLI-only create
  flags absent from the GUI panel: upmix, filename channel-routing, reel splitting,
  pad head/tail, sign language, HDR tonemap, delivery profiles, versions/multi.
- Sony RAW / X-OCN is detected but undecodable (ffmpeg can't decode it), same as
  ARRIRAW/R3D/BRAW/Canon: a match only yields a clearer detected-but-undecodable
  error. postkit's detect_format matches Sony's private essence ULs in the .mxf
  header. Caveat: those ULs are reverse-engineered from MediaInfo, NOT
  SMPTE-registered, and mark the Sony RAW family without distinguishing X-OCN
  ST/LT/XT tiers (fine, since the match only sharpens the error). Non-Sony .mxf
  still resolves to DNxHR.

## Done 2026-07-23

App-side feature batch (create surface, KDM, conform, GUI). All items have tests.

- Credentialed vendor cert download (dom#2705/2706): `cert-fetch` gained
  christie/gdc/barco with `--user`/`--password`. Path builders (christie 12-digit
  zero-pad + F-IMB->IMB-S2 fallback, gdc /SHA256, barco 10-char + first7-xxx dir)
  are unit-tested. Credentials go to curl via a stdin config (`-K -`), never argv
  or logs. Anonymous dolby/qube paths unchanged. No config-file storage exists for
  cert-fetch, so creds are CLI-only.
- DCI HDR Addendum (dom#2374/2799): `create --hdr-dci` authors an HDR DCP. The
  picture MXF is wrapped through asdcplib `jp2k::open_write_hdr`
  (CORE/mxf_wrap.rs `wrap_j2k_hdr_files`), setting TransferCharacteristic=ST 2084
  (PQ) + ColorPrimaries=P3-D65 on the essence descriptor. Validates the flag combo
  (needs `--hdr-to-dci-lut` or `--hdr-already-pq`) and the raised per-codestream cap
  up front; fails loud with 3D or reel splitting. Roundtrip test reads the descriptor
  back and asserts both ULs.
- Closed captions (CCAP, ST 428-10/429-12): `create --ccap <file>` wraps timed text
  with a MainClosedCaption role, carried through every CPL path: single-reel
  (CORE/cpl.rs + CORE/dcp.rs), reel splitting (reel.rs), versions (a `ccap` manifest
  field, versions.rs), and VF (vf.rs, `--add-ccap`/`--replace-ccap` REEL=PATH). Same
  input formats as `--subtitle`. Tests mirror the subtitle-path tests.
- conform full assembly: `conform --media-dir <dir> --output <dir>` resolves every
  EDL/xmeml reel to media (fails loud on unresolved reels), then drives the reel plan
  to a finished multi-reel DCP (per-reel grok encode + MXF wrap via create_dcp, then
  assemble.rs CPL assembly). conform_plan.json + the postkit conform manifest stay as
  artifacts. Gated e2e test builds a 2-reel DCP from a tiny EDL over synthetic media
  and verifies it with dcpdoctor.
- Trailer: `trailer` now encodes the packaged mp4 to J2K and builds a real trailer
  DCP (ContentKind=trailer) in `<output>/dcp` via the grok encode + create_dcp path.
- Markers: `markers --marker LABEL=timecode` (repeatable) places any of the ten
  defined markers, validating the label and the offset (frame or HH:MM:SS:FF) against
  the composition length. Default set stays FFOC/LFOC.
- ingest `--lut`: threads a 3D LUT through postkit ingest (ffmpeg lut3d). Was
  hardcoded false.
- KDM `--annotation`: CLI flag -> postkit `KdmConfig.annotation` (CORE/kdm.rs). None
  keeps the derived "<title> KDM for <recipient>" text. Test asserts the override
  lands, escaped, in the KDM XML.
- Colour `--target p3-d65`: routes through postkit `DcdmTarget::P3D65` alongside the
  xyz branch (CLI `parse_dcdm_target`), both through the real DCDM transform. Unit
  test covers the mapping. (grok/postkit RGB->X'Y'Z' harmonization landed earlier in
  postkit 32838ea; colour.rs tests assert agreement with grok's [2817,2183,870].)
- Job queue: create jobs report coarse stage progress (dcp::ProgressSink) instead of
  0->100; cancel affects running jobs (per-job AtomicBool checked in the job loop +
  between create_dcp stages, worker on its own thread); `serve` proxies every job
  route to the shared daemon queue over IPC (one queue) and returns 503 when the
  daemon is down.
- combine.rs dedup: dropped the local `inject_annotation` string-splice; the merged
  PKL/ASSETMAP carry AnnotationText via the postkit packaging fields
  (`generate_pkl`/`generate_assetmap` gained an `annotation` arg). Output stays
  byte-identical (combine tests pass). `combine --annotation` exposes the override.
- DTS:X: the mxf_wrap essence-type comment and the docs point DTS:X at the IAB
  (`--atmos`, ST 429-18) path. There is no separate DTS:X CLI surface. Rationale: no
  public DTS:X DataEssenceCoding UL exists (SMPTE registers have only DTS private
  nodes; asdcplib/libdcp carry nothing). Since ST 429-18/-19 (2019), DTS:X is
  delivered as a standard IAB track per ST 2098-2 ("DTS:X for IAB").
- GUI create panel: the tauri `submit_job` -> JobConfig -> run_job path carries
  right-eye 3D (second run_encode_with_ratio into `<output>/right/j2k`, stereo_3d
  derived from its presence), Atmos track, subtitle file + language, CCAP + language,
  and loudness target + true-peak ceiling (loudness::adjust_loudness on the WAV before
  wrapping). content kind / bandwidth / encryption were already wired. index.html
  gained the 3D / Audio / Subtitles-&-Captions fieldsets; main.js added the browse
  handlers + submit_job args. `--hdr-dci` deliberately skipped (see Open). Fixed in
  passing: gui create_vf built a ReplacementReel without the `ccap` field added this
  batch (the gui crate did not compile at 209a83d); set `ccap: None`.

## Keep in sync with imfwizard (deliberately duplicated, no clean shared home)

The shared *logic* already lives in postkit (mpv::MpvPlayer, packaging writers,
escape_xml, parse_srt, pipeline::run_encode). What remains duplicated is app/framework
glue with no clean cross-repo home, left as copies. If you edit one side, mirror the
other:

- gui/src-tauri/src/preview_server.rs — near-identical (only the MpvPlayer app name
  differs). NOT moved to postkit: it is all `#[tauri::command]` wrappers and postkit
  has no tauri dep (also used by the CLI and wasm). The reusable part (MpvPlayer) is
  already in postkit::mpv. dcpwizard also keeps a windows preview_server_stub the imf
  side lacks.
- gui/src/preview.js, gui/vite.config.js — frontend files (differ only by var order /
  dev port); the GUIs don't consume JS from the postkit crate, so no home.
- gui/src-tauri/src/lib.rs, gui/src-tauri/src/pipeline.rs — app-specific tauri setup
  and build orchestration; they delegate the encode to postkit::pipeline but diverged
  enough that unifying would need per-divergence config flags. The 2026-07-23
  create-panel wiring edited dcpwizard pipeline.rs (right-eye 3D via a second
  run_encode_with_ratio, atmos_path, subtitle + language, ccap + language, loudness
  normalize before wrap) and main.js/index.html (new pickers). imfwizard already
  submits compositions with subtitles/audio; the atmos + loudness-normalize-before-wrap
  and single-DCP 3D right-eye bits are dcpwizard-specific (IMF has no atmos aux track /
  stereoscopic DCP concept), so nothing to mirror unless imfwizard adds a loudness step.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml, release.yml, gui-release.yml — copies across dcpwizard,
  imfwizard, dcpdoctor differing by binary/artifact names + per-app build deps.
  Separate git repos, so no shared reusable-workflow without a central repo. Keep
  aligned by hand. Every job that compiles the rust workspace has a cached "Setup grok"
  step that builds grok v20.3.6 from source, installs to $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/grok-install,
  and exports PKG_CONFIG_PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH via $GITHUB_ENV (actions/cache keyed on
  grok tag + runner os). Linux + macOS only; windows legs are continue-on-error.
  imfwizard mirrors the step but only in ci (it runs grk_compress at runtime, does not
  link grok-ffi); dcpdoctor needs no grok.
- tests/cli_flags_test.sh — NOT the same harness as imfwizard's (this one runs the
  binary and checks clap parse errors; imf parses main.js). Different CLIs, leave
  separate.
