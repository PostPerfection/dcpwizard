# DCP Wizard

[![CI](https://github.com/PostPerfection/dcpwizard/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PostPerfection/dcpwizard/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

[Documentation](https://postperfection.github.io/dcpwizard/)

Digital Cinema Package (DCP) creator, CLI tool and desktop GUI.

Version 1.2 creates consistent CPL, PKL, and ASSETMAP identities for SMPTE and Interop packages. Grok is the JPEG 2000 encoder.

## Overview

DCP Wizard creates valid DCPs (Digital Cinema Packages) from video sources,
image sequences, and WAV audio, conforming to SMPTE ST 429 (Bv2.1) and Interop standards.

Free and open-source alternative to easyDCP Creator+.

## Features

### DCP Creation & Packaging
- **Original Version (OV) DCP** creation from J2K + WAV
- **Pre-build check** on `create`: every refusal the packager can make is made before the encode starts, from one shared check, so a job that cannot be packaged fails in a second instead of after an hour of J2K. `create --check` runs that check plus the advisory hints and stops, encoding nothing and writing nothing under `--output`
- **SMPTE & Interop** standard support
- **2K and 4K** resolution (2048×1080, 4096×2160)
- **Frame rates** 24, 25, 30 fps (2K/4K); HFR 48, 50, 60 fps (2K only)
- **Reel splitting** via `create --reel-length <minutes>` (multi-reel CPL, sample-accurate audio and per-reel subtitle boundaries)
- **Explicit reel splits** via `create --split-at <tc>[,<tc>...]` (HH:MM:SS or HH:MM:SS:FF) or `create --split-chapters` (source chapter marks via ffprobe)
- **Custom picture container** via `create --container <2k-scope|...>` or `create --container-dims WxH` (even, within the 2K/4K bound): the container is the raster the picture is encoded at, so a scope package is 2048x858 frames, the CPL's stored area, active area and aspect all read back from that essence, and the container names the 2K or 4K family without `--twok`/`--fourk`
- **Automatic source fitting**: the source is scaled into the container preserving its aspect, so a 1920x1080 HD master with `--container 2k-scope` encodes at 2048x858 with letterbox bars only where the aspects differ. `--twok`/`--fourk` with no container fit the source onto the full 2048x1080 or 4096x2160 frame instead of refusing it
- **Source picture processing** on `create`: `--crop-left/--crop-right/--crop-top/--crop-bottom <px>` (source pixels, before any rotation), `--auto-crop` with `--auto-crop-threshold <0..1>` (black borders measured over the content), `--fill-crop` (crop to the container aspect so the picture fills the frame), `--deinterlace`, `--denoise`, `--rotate 90|180|270` (clockwise) and `--flip horizontal|vertical|both`
- **Head/tail padding** via `create --pad-head <dur> --pad-tail <dur>` (`48f`/`2s`), with `--pad-color <RRGGBB>` for a filled pad instead of black
- **Trim** via `create --trim-start <dur> --trim-end <dur>` (same syntax), cutting the source before any padding; picture, sound and subtitles move together
- **Still images** via `create --video <image> --still-length <dur>`: one image held for a duration, encoded once and repeated
- **Source colour space** via `create --source-colourspace rec709|p3|rec2020|xyz|logc` (default `rec709`), declaring what the source carries; P3, Rec.2020 and ARRI LogC3 are converted to X'Y'Z' during the encode
- **Input decode range** override via `create --input-range full|legal`, correcting wrong or absent source range flags
- **High Bitrate (HBR)**, up to 500 Mbps for demanding content
- **CPL / PKL / ASSETMAP / VOLINDEX** generation
- **Multi-version packages** via `create --versions <file>`: one package with several CPLs sharing the same picture/sound essence, differing by subtitle and/or audio track (multiple language versions over one master)
- **Multi-composition packages** via `create-multi --compositions <manifest>`: one CPL per manifest entry, each with its own picture/sound/subtitle, over one shared PKL/ASSETMAP
- **Assemble** a new OV from existing DCPs via `assemble --input <dcp>... --output --title` (reels in order, essence copied byte-identical by UUID)
- **Edit** CPL metadata (title/annotation/content-kind/issuer) without re-wrapping essence via `edit --input`
- **Decrypt** an encrypted DCP to cleartext via `decrypt --input --output` with `--kdm --recipient-key` or `--keys`. Every essence round-trips: picture, sound, subtitle, closed caption and Atmos
- **Sign-language video** track via `create --sign-language-video <file> --sign-language-lang <rfc5646>` (ISDCF Doc 13, SLVS on sound channel 15)
- **ISDCF content titles** via `create --isdcf-name`: the title is rebuilt to the ISDCF naming convention from what the package actually carries (content type, container aspect, audio and text languages, channel ladder, territory and rating, resolution, studio, date, facility, standard). `--audio-lang`, `--rating AGENCY=LABEL` (repeatable), `--content-version` (repeatable), `--studio`, `--territory-type`, `--isdcf-date`, `--temp-version`, `--pre-release`, `--red-band`, `--two-d-version-of-three-d` and `--version-file` feed it, and the metadata among them lands in the CPL with or without the naming flag
- **Ratings and content version in the CPL**: `--rating` fills the `RatingList` and the first `--content-version` is the `ContentVersion` LabelText
- **Bv2.1 CompositionMetadataAsset** (ST 429-16) in the first reel of SMPTE CPLs, with `MainSoundConfiguration` derived from the packaged channel count
- **CPL markers** (ST 429-7 `MainMarkers`) in every created composition: FFOC/LFOC by default, or place any of the ten defined markers with `create --marker LABEL=timecode` (repeatable, frame number or HH:MM:SS:FF; single-reel only)
- **Re-ingest packaging** via `ingest-package <dir>`: rebuild ASSETMAP and PKL to cover every asset file present (for exported OV/VF folders whose ASSETMAP/PKL omit hardlinked assets), no re-wrap
- **SHA-1 hashing** for integrity verification

### Encoding & Transcoding
- **JPEG 2000 encoding** via Grok (create, pipeline, and DCP transcode paths)
- **CPU and GPU encoding**: CPU encoding uses the available cores by default. `--gpu` or the desktop GPU setting enables Grok's accelerator plugin for JPEG 2000 encode and decode. An explicit `--gpu` fails if the plugin cannot start, while a saved desktop preference warns and continues on the CPU. `--no-gpu` forces the CPU
- **Video file import**, QuickTime (.mov), MP4, MXF, AVI, MKV
- **Video transcoding**, ProRes, H.264, H.265, DNxHR → image sequence → J2K (via ffmpeg)
- **Image sequence input**, DPX, TIFF, EXR, PNG, JPEG, BMP
- **Scale / Crop / Letterbox**, target resolution adaptation
- **Colour conversion** to XYZ (DCI, gamma 2.6)
- **Encode QoL** on `create`: `--start-at` (scheduled wall-clock start), `--resume` (reuse on-disk J2K frames after an interruption, survives restarts), average-fps ETA in progress output, `--shutdown-when-done` (power off after a clean encode)

### Encryption & KDM
- **AES-128 essence encryption** of picture, sound, timed text and Atmos, content keys generated with a CSPRNG, encrypted at wrap time
- **Signed SMPTE KDM** (ST 430-1 / 430-3) carrying the DCP's content keys, one per essence (MDIK, MDAK, MDSK, MDEK)
- **Batch KDM**, generate for multiple screens in one pass
- **DKDM re-wrap**, re-issue KDMs from a Distribution KDM
- **KDM formulation** via `--formulation` on `kdm`/`kdm-batch`/`kdm-rewrap` (the four ISDCF Doc 5 spellings; derived from `--device-cert` when omitted)
- **Forensic marking control** via `-p/--disable-forensic-marking-picture` and `-a/--disable-forensic-marking-audio [CHANNEL]`, for press and festival screenings
- **Certificate generation**, X.509 cert chain (root → intermediate → signer)
- **Certificate inspection**, display subject, issuer, validity, thumbprint, CA status

### Subtitles & Captions
- **SRT → SMPTE / Interop subtitle XML** conversion, anchored near the bottom with configurable `--vposition` (percent from the bottom, default 8%)
- **Subtitle packaging** into a DCP timed-text track (ST 428-7 DCST wrapped as an MXF, registered in the CPL) via `create --subtitle`
- **Input formats** beyond SRT: `create --subtitle` accepts `.ass`/`.ssa` (styling + alignment), `.pac` (EBU binary, Latin codepage), `.mks`/`.mkv` (Matroska subtitle stream via ffmpeg), `.fcpxml` (captions/titles) and an Interop `DCSubtitle` XML carrying PNG bitmap subs. Styling (italic/bold/underline/colour) and per-cue alignment/position are carried into the DCST; supplied SMPTE DCST XML is still wrapped unchanged.
- **Placement controls** on `create`: `--subtitle-halign left|center|right`, `--subtitle-valign top|center|bottom` (top-anchored subtitles grow downward), `--subtitle-vposition <pct>`, so SRT is no longer always centred-bottom
- **3D subtitle depth** via `create --subtitle-zposition <v>` (SMPTE ST 428-7 Zposition emitted on every cue). Note: the timed-text descriptor's "Z-Position In Use" flag is not set by the current asdcplib writer.
- **RTL subtitles** (`create --subtitle-rtl auto|on|off`, default auto): Hebrew/Arabic is reshaped and reordered to visual order so servers that skip the bidi algorithm render it correctly
- **Auto line-wrap** via `create --subtitle-wrap <chars>`: long lines wrap on whitespace (never mid-word), preserving styling
- **Font embedding + subsetting** via `create --subtitle-font <ttf/otf>`: the font is subset to the used glyphs (SMPTE 640 KB limit, fails loud if exceeded) and embedded in the timed-text MXF, referenced by a `LoadFont`; `--subtitle-no-subset` embeds the whole font. Under reel splitting the font is referenced by one shared asset id in every reel.
- **Timed-text appearance** on `create`: `--subtitle-font-size <points>`, `--subtitle-colour <RRGGBB[AA]>`, `--subtitle-effect none|outline|shadow`, `--subtitle-effect-colour <RRGGBB[AA]>`, `--subtitle-fade-up <ms>` and `--subtitle-fade-down <ms>` write the ST 428-7 `Font` attributes and the per-cue fades. Defaults are the ones the track has always carried: 42 points, white on a black shadow, a twelfth of a second each way. An outline is written as the standard's `border`. They style the `--subtitle` track only, so `--ccap` keeps the default appearance
- **Subtitle editing** on standalone files via `subtitle-edit`: `--list` cues, `--shift-ms` all cues, or `--index N` with `--text` / `--set-start-ms`+`--set-end-ms`, written back as SRT (it edits source files, never subtitles inside a finished DCP)
- **Subtitle extraction** from a DCP or subtitle asset back to `.srt` (timed) or `.txt` (text only) via `subtitle-extract`; reads MXF-wrapped ST 428-7 and loose SMPTE/Interop XML, concatenating reels with their timeline offsets
- **Multilingual subtitles** with RFC 5646 language tags
- **Burn-in during the encode** via `create --burn-subtitle <file>` (+ `--burn-subtitle-font <ttf/otf>`): the cues are drawn into the picture as it encodes, so a burnt festival print costs one generation rather than two. Takes the same formats `--subtitle` does, and covers video, image sequences and held stills. Burnt text is part of the image and registers no timed-text track; the same file cannot be both, and burning onto an already-X'Y'Z' source or a J2K directory is refused
- **Burn-in appearance** on `create`: `--burn-font-size <pct of frame height>`, `--burn-colour <RRGGBB[AA]>`, `--burn-effect none|outline|shadow`, `--burn-effect-colour <RRGGBB[AA]>`, `--burn-outline-width <pct of text height>`, `--burn-line-height <multiple of text height>`, `--burn-margin <pct of frame height>`, `--burn-x-scale`, `--burn-y-scale`, `--burn-fade-up <ms>` and `--burn-fade-down <ms>`. Each is laid over postkit's burn defaults, so an unnamed one keeps the value it always had. Any of them without `--burn-subtitle` is refused by name
- **Subtitle burn-in as a standalone pass** via `burnin`, for a review copy rather than a package: it writes a video file, so a DCP burn goes through `create --burn-subtitle` instead of this. `--font-size`, `--colour <RRGGBB>` and `--position top|center|bottom` style the cues, and `--video-codec <encoder>` with `--crf <n>` name the output encoder and its quality rather than leaving both to ffmpeg's guess from the output file name: `--video-codec libx264 --crf 0` writes a lossless copy

### Audio
- **PCM audio wrapping** (48 kHz)
- **Loudness measurement**, EBU R128 / ATSC A/85
- **Loudness normalization** to a target via `create --loudness-target leqm=<db>|lufs=<v>` (with `--true-peak-ceiling`)
- **Channel mapping matrix** via `create --audio-map <IN:OUT[@GAIN],...>`: any source channel to any DCP lane at any gain in dB, summing where several land on one lane. OUT is a lane name (L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs, Lc, Rc, BsL, BsR, HI, VI) or a 1-based number, and the track is widened to the smallest DCP sound layout that holds every named lane
- **Packaged channel count** via `create --audio-channels 2|6|8|16`: the sound track is filled with silent channels up to the count, so a stereo source ships in a 16-channel container without an upmix. Without the flag a 5.1 source is widened to 16 and everything else is packaged at its own width. A source wider than the count is refused, with `--audio-map` to fold channels instead
- **Stereo→5.1 upmix** at create via `create --upmix a|b`
- **Audio delay** via `create --audio-delay <ms>` (positive later, negative earlier), keeping the running time
- **Filename channel auto-routing**: point `create --audio` at a directory of mono `name_L.wav`/`_R`/`_C`/`_Lfe`/`_Ls`/`_Rs`… files
- **Crossfade join** of two WAVs via `crossfade --a --b -o --overlap`
- **Mid-side decode** via `mid-side-decode -i -o --mid --side`
- **WAV audio** input

### Quality Control
- **Integrated QC** via dcpdoctor (SMPTE Bv2.1 compliance checking)
- **HTML QC report** generation, with a Sound level section: Leq(m) per ISO 21727 for every sound track, against the content kind's limit (82 dB advertisement, 85 dB trailer). `report --scan-picture` adds a Picture section, decoding each picture track for black and frozen runs; it is off by default because the J2K decode is ffmpeg's software one and a feature takes hours, and a report made without it says the picture was not scanned
- **DCP verification**, validate structure, hashes, XML schemas
- **Markers**, FFOC, LFOC, FFTC, LFTC, FFOI, LFOI, FFEC, LFEC, FFMC, LFMC; the
  default set is FFOC/LFOC, place any of the others with `--marker LABEL=timecode`

### HDR & Dolby Vision
- **HDR detection**, auto-detect SDR, HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, HLG from source
- **Dolby Vision RPU injection** via dovi_tool
- **HDR10 static metadata** injection (SMPTE ST 2086 + CTA 861.3)
- **HDR format conversion**, HDR10 ↔ HLG ↔ SDR tone mapping
- **HDR source delivery** via `create --hdr-to-dci-lut <lut>` (runs the LUT before J2K encode); `--allow-generic-hdr-tonemap` opts into FFmpeg tone mapping with a warning, and is refused with `--hdr-dci`. `create --hdr-dci` authors a DCI HDR Addendum DCP from an HDR master: the picture MXF is stamped with TransferCharacteristic=ST 2084 (PQ), the CPL carries the ST 429-16 `Image Encoding Parameters` extension with EOTF `ST 2084`, and the ISDCF name takes the `HDR1` content modifier. The master's own colour tags name the grade, or `--hdr-source <hdr10|hdr10plus|hlg|pq-p3d65|dolby-vision>` names it (an HDR10+ master and a Dolby Vision profile 8.1 base layer are both read as their HDR10 grade, and Dolby Vision profile 5 is refused). `--hdr-peak-nits <cd/m²>` is where the roll-off starts, defaulting to the master's MaxCLL, then its mastering display maximum, then 1000. An SDR or untagged master is refused. `--hdr-to-dci-lut` and `--hdr-already-pq` are the other two paths to PQ. A `--burn-subtitle` or `--watermark` is refused on any of the three: both draw in display RGB and the frames are no longer that. Not available with 3D or reel splitting

### Timeline Conform
- **Timeline conform** from EDL (CMX 3600) / FCP7 XML (xmeml) / FCPX (fcpxml): parse, or with `--media-dir --output` resolve every reel to media and build a finished multi-reel DCP (per-reel encode + wrap + CPL assembly). The reel/asset plan (`conform_plan.json`) and conform manifest are kept as artifacts

### Export & Playback
- **Export DCP** to ProRes, H.264, H.265, DNxHR, or image sequence
- **Frame extraction**, extract individual frames as images (thumbnails/preview)
- **Frame-accurate preview**: DCP directories, CPLs, picture MXFs and J2K directories decode in process through Grok. The CPU worker pool sustains 2K playback, and the accelerator plugin adds device decode and the X'Y'Z' to display-RGB transform for 4K playback. MP4, ProRes and other sources use libmpv. Encrypted and stereoscopic J2K also use libmpv

### Delivery & Automation
- **Copy to drive** with a free-space precheck and post-copy hash verification (USB/CRU); **format-drive** (ext2/ext3, volume label, mounted-target refusal) and **check-drive** (report fs type + label) for cinema hard-drive delivery
- **Watch folder**: `watch DIR --output OUT` builds a DCP from every video file or frame folder dropped into `DIR` once it stops changing, using the file stem as the title and a same-named `.wav` and `.srt` beside it as sound and subtitle. The job log is written beside the package, the source moves into `done/` or `failed/`, `--webhook-url` posts `dcp.created` or `dcp.failed`, `--interval` sets the poll seconds and any `create` flags after `--` apply to every package
- **Job queue** with progress tracking and cancellation
- **REST API** for headless/batch operation
- **Prometheus metrics endpoint** (`GET /metrics`), job counts, daemon status for monitoring
- **Docker container** for CI/CD pipelines
- **CLI scriptable**, all features accessible from command line
- **Version dashboard**, OV/VF management, territory tracking, distribution matrix export
- **Webhook notifications**, HTTP callbacks on job completion/failure
- **TMS upload**, push a finished package to a theatre management system over sftp (host key checked against `known_hosts`) or ftp, on its own or straight after a build

### Mastering & Compliance
- **DCDM creation**, Digital Cinema Distribution Master (X'Y'Z' 12/16-bit) intermediate
- **Visible watermarking** via `watermark`, a text mark (distributor ID/serial) burnt into an existing DCP's JPEG 2000 picture essence, with `--font-size` as a percent of the frame height, `--colour`, `--position top|center|bottom` and `--font`. The picture is decoded, marked and re-encoded at its own average bandwidth unless `--video-bit-rate` names another; sound and timed text ship unchanged, and `--kdm`/`--recipient-key`/`--keys` mark an encrypted source. `create --watermark TEXT` marks at build time instead
- **Trailer packaging**, ratings cards (MPAA/BBFC/FSK), green/red band, countdown leaders; the packaged mp4 is then encoded and wrapped into a real trailer DCP
- **Content version tracker**, SQLite database of which version delivered where and when
- **Accessibility compliance**, read the closed-caption asset and the HI, VI-N and sign-language channels off a package and check them against CVAA, EAA, AODA or Ofcom. Each list below is dcpwizard's own mapping of the access services an instrument names onto DCP tracks rather than a citation, since the EAA, AODA and Ofcom instruments all name access services for broadcast, on-demand or web delivery and none of them names a cinema deliverable:
  - CVAA requires a closed-caption asset and a VI-N narration channel, and recommends an HI mix channel
  - EAA requires a closed-caption asset and a VI-N narration channel, and recommends sign-language video and an HI mix channel
  - AODA requires a closed-caption asset, and recommends a VI-N narration channel and an HI mix channel
  - Ofcom requires a closed-caption asset and a VI-N narration channel, and recommends sign-language video

## Installation

### Pre-built binaries (recommended)

Download from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/PostPerfection/dcpwizard/releases/latest) page:

| Platform | CLI | Desktop GUI |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Linux** (x86_64) | `dcpwizard-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | `dcpwizard-macos-aarch64.tar.gz` | `.dmg` |
| **Windows** (x86_64) | `dcpwizard-windows-x86_64.zip` | `.msi` |

The CLI links the Grok JPEG 2000 library (libgrokj2k) dynamically, and each archive carries it in `lib/` beside the binary. Unpack the archive and run the binary from where it sits: nothing has to be installed and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` does not have to be set.

The desktop packages carry libgrokj2k too, in `/usr/lib/dcpwizard`. They need libmpv for the preview player, which the package manager pulls in:

```bash
sudo apt install ./dcpwizard_*_amd64.deb     # Debian, Ubuntu
sudo dnf install ./dcpwizard-*.x86_64.rpm    # Fedora, with RPM Fusion enabled for mpv-libs
```

The `.AppImage` carries libmpv as well and needs nothing installed. For the `.dmg`, install libmpv with `brew install mpv`.

### Install from source

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config libxml2-dev libssl-dev libxerces-c-dev libasound2-dev
# For GUI: also install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev

# Grok (libgrokj2k) must be discoverable by pkg-config at build time and its
# shared lib loadable at runtime. Build it from source or install a release, then:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/grok/lib64/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/grok/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

cd rust
cargo build --release
# Binary at rust/target/release/dcpwizard
```

#### macOS

```bash
brew install pkg-config libxml2 openssl@3 xerces-c

export OPENSSL_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@3)
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix openssl@3)/lib/pkgconfig:$(brew --prefix libxml2)/lib/pkgconfig:$(brew --prefix xerces-c)/lib/pkgconfig"
```

Grok must be on `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` at build time and its shared library
loadable at runtime. After a local grok install (see
[Grok INSTALL.md](https://github.com/GrokImageCompression/grok/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
GPU plugin section):

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/grok/install/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/grok/install/lib${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
```

Homebrew's ffmpeg is **not** the one CI uses. It is built without libzimg, so
the HDR decode chain has no `zscale` filter. Install the same arm64 9.0.1
build as `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and put it first on `PATH`:

```bash
base=https://ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de/download/macos/arm64/1787073674_9.0.1
mkdir -p "$HOME/ffmpeg-bin"
for tool in ffmpeg ffprobe; do
  curl -fsSL --retry 5 --retry-all-errors -o "$tool.zip" "$base/$tool.zip"
  unzip -q -o "$tool.zip" -d "$HOME/ffmpeg-bin"
  chmod +x "$HOME/ffmpeg-bin/$tool"
done
shasum -a 256 -c <<'SUMS'
8287a1b2229e05eb41859f073e18e6c52c60a778f2f5e6881070fe51b79407fe  ffmpeg.zip
102a26b8940a053298d9929bfaae71e4b6ef65ba5f19a99a88c433108560741a  ffprobe.zip
SUMS
export PATH="$HOME/ffmpeg-bin:$PATH"
```

`ffmpeg -version` should print `9.0.1-https://www.martin-riedl.de` and
`ffmpeg -filters` should list `zscale`. Keep this directory ahead of
`/opt/homebrew/bin` (`brew shellenv` prepends Homebrew).

```bash
cd rust
cargo build --release
# Binary at rust/target/release/dcpwizard
```

#### Windows

```powershell
# Using vcpkg (recommended)
vcpkg install libxml2 openssl xerces-c --triplet x64-windows

$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "$env:VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT"

cd rust
cargo build --release
```

### Optional runtime dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `ffmpeg` | Video transcoding and import. Needs ffmpeg 8+ with libzimg (`zscale`). | Linux: CI uses [BtbN n8.1 gpl](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases). macOS: **not Homebrew** — see the macOS install section (martin-riedl 9.0.1 arm64). Windows: BtbN n8.1 win64 gpl. |
| `mpv` | GUI preview player for sources that are not JPEG 2000. Required to *link* the GUI (`libmpv`). | `apt install libmpv-dev` / `brew install mpv` / [mpv.io](https://mpv.io/installation/) |

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t dcpwizard .
docker run -v /path/to/media:/data dcpwizard create \
    --title "My Film" --video /data/j2k --audio /data/audio.wav --output /data/dcp
```

### Desktop GUI

The GUI uses [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app/) (Rust backend + web frontend) with a single-window layout inspired by professional NLEs.

**GUI features:**
- Drag & drop file import (video, audio, subtitle)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N/O/B/P/I, Ctrl+1–7 for views, Space/arrows/Home during preview). Ctrl+K opens the shortcut list, where clicking a shortcut rebinds it (Backspace clears, Escape cancels) and the rebindings are saved
- Recent projects quick-access list
- Right-click context menus on assets (Preview, Remove, Show in Files)
- Asset filter / search
- Auto-detect framerate and resolution from imported video (via ffprobe)
- Pre-build hints: a Before you build dialog lists what will package but is likely to be wrong on a cinema screen, with Build anyway or Go back. Turn it off from the dialog or in Settings ("Show hints before building"), and the hints still reach the job log
- Post-build actions: a finished build offers Play (the new DCP in the embedded preview), Inspect (the Verify view, already pointed at the output and running) and Reveal (the output folder in the file manager), beside the progress bar. Starting another build clears the row
- Per-stage timings in the job log: `[TIMING]` lines next to each stage's own log lines giving preflight, encode, audio, packaging and validation time, plus the total
- Progress in title bar (visible in taskbar during builds)
- Desktop notifications on build complete/fail
- Conditional button enabling (Build disabled until ready)
- Built-in preview player with timeline scrubber (click-to-seek, drag-to-scrub, timecode display). A DCP, a picture MXF, a CPL or a directory of codestreams plays through grok, in process, at 2K real time on the CPU and at 4K real time on the device when the GPU setting is on. Everything else plays through mpv. The header strip carries the QC controls: safe area, aspect mask, centre cross, thirds grid, the crop the build will apply, decode resolution and the subtitle and closed-caption tracks
- Multi-CPL composition tabs, switch, add, remove compositions
- SRT → SMPTE subtitle conversion panel
- Subtitle extraction panel (DCP/asset → SRT or text)
- Subtitle burn-in panel
- Target resolution conversion panel (2K/4K scope/flat/full)
- GPU encoding toggle (grok acceleration)

```bash
# GUI extras: Node (pnpm) and libmpv. On macOS: brew install node pnpm mpv

grok looks for `libgrokj2k_plugin` in the directory `GRK_PLUGIN_PATH` names, then in the working directory, then in the executable's own directory, and never on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, or `PATH`. A GUI launched without `GRK_PLUGIN_PATH` therefore encodes and previews on the CPU even with the GPU toggle on. On Metal the same directory must also contain `grok_kernels.metallib`.

```bash
# rebuilds the GUI against that grok and launches it with the plugin on the
# loader path. Linux looks in lib64/ then lib/ for libgrokj2k_plugin.so,
# macOS in lib/ then lib64/ for the dylib plus grok_kernels.metallib, Windows
# in bin/ then lib/ for grokj2k_plugin.dll.
python3 run-gpu-gui.py /path/to/grok/install

# Linux
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/grok/lib64
export GRK_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/grok/lib64

# macOS (dylib + metallib live in lib/ after cmake --install)
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/grok/install/lib
export GRK_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/grok/install/lib
export GRK_DEBUG=3                     # log the plugin load path and Metal/CUDA device

# from the dcpwizard repo root
./gui/src-tauri/target/release/dcpwizard-gui
```

When the saved registration URL is the local development server at
`http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/register`, the script starts that server if needed.
It reads the standard development keys under `~/.config/gpup_license_keys` and
finds the plugin source under the shared `Grok/grok` workspace.

A desktop launcher inherits neither variable, so put both on the `.desktop` Exec line or in `~/.config/environment.d`.

**GPU encode (CLI).** `--gpu` refuses to start if the plugin cannot load. ffmpeg uses `-hwaccel cuda` on Linux/Windows and `-hwaccel videotoolbox` on macOS. The job log at `<output>/dcpwizard.log` confirms the device ran: the header prints `Accelerator: requested, active` and the encode is followed by `[ENCODE] Frames on the device: N of M`. `create` writes the same log beside the package it builds. Progress prints `colour_transform_on_device=true` when Rec.709→DCI X'Y'Z' (or planar YUV) ran on the device.

```bash
dcpwizard --gpu create \
  --title "My Film" \
  --video movie.mp4 \
  --output ./dcp \
  --twok --frame-rate 24 --content-type FTR
```

**GPU preview (GUI).** Settings → *Encode on the GPU (grok accelerator plugin)*. The checkbox is stored as `"gpu": true` in `preferences.json` (`~/Library/Application Support/dcpwizard/` on macOS, `~/.config/dcpwizard/` on Linux). Status should read `GPU encoding on`; if the plugin is missing it falls back to CPU and says `GPU encoding unavailable`.

Then **Open** (Ctrl+O) a DCP directory, picture MXF, or CPL, and play. JPEG 2000 plays in-process through grok (not mpv). A device batch prints on stderr:

```
grok player decode backend: device, colour on the device
```

`colour on the cpu` means the plugin decoded but the X'Y'Z'→sRGB (or App 2E display LUT) ran on the host. The preview surface also logs its GL renderer, e.g. `[preview] GL renderer: Apple M5 (4.1 Metal - …)`.

A plugin built with the CMake default `GPUP_ENABLE_AUTH=OFF` does not ask for a licence. With auth on, fill *Grok License* and *Registration URL* in Settings (or `--license` / `--registration-url` on the CLI). See the grok-gpu-plugin README.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Create a DCP
dcpwizard create --title "My Feature Film" --video ./j2k --audio ./audio.wav --output ./dcp

# Create from video file (full pipeline: decode → J2K encode → MXF wrap → DCP)
dcpwizard create --title "My Film" --video movie.mov --output ./dcp

# Same, JPEG 2000 on grok's accelerator plugin (fails if the plugin cannot load)
dcpwizard --gpu create --title "My Film" --video movie.mov --output ./dcp --twok

# Check the job before committing to the encode: every refusal, then every hint.
# Nothing is encoded and nothing is written under --output. Exits 1 on a refusal.
dcpwizard create --title "My Film" --video movie.mov --output ./dcp --check

# Transcode an existing DCP's picture essence to a lower bandwidth (audio and
# subtitle tracks are copied unchanged; encrypted input is rejected)
dcpwizard transcode-dcp --input ./dcp --output ./dcp_light --video-bit-rate 100

# Create with encryption. Content keys are generated with a CSPRNG and every
# essence is AES-128 encrypted at wrap time: picture, sound, subtitle,
# closed caption and Atmos each get their own key. --key-out is required: it is
# the only place the keys are written (never next to the DCP). That file holds
# the plaintext keys, keep it secret and outside the DCP. Feed it to
# `kdm --keys`, which puts every key in the KDM.
dcpwizard create --title "My Film" --video ./j2k --audio ./audio.wav --output ./dcp \
    --encrypt --key-out ./secret/my_film.keys.json

# Create a signed DCP. The CPL and PKL get an XML-DSig ds:Signature (SMPTE
# ST 429-7/-8), which encrypted packages require and validators such as
# ClairMeta expect. --signer-chain takes the CA certificates above the leaf,
# intermediate(s) then root, and is repeatable. Signing is opt-in: without
# --signer-cert the package is written unsigned as before. The private key is
# read straight from the file by dcpwizard, never passed to another process.
dcpwizard create --title "My Film" --video ./j2k --output ./dcp \
    --signer-cert signer.pem --signer-key signer.key \
    --signer-chain intermediate.pem --signer-chain root.pem

# Encode to a quality target instead of a ratio. --quality-psnr is a PSNR target
# in dB, at least 20 and at most 80. The encoder allocates to that quality rather
# than to a compression ratio, and --video-bit-rate becomes a per-frame byte cap
# no frame may exceed: a frame the quality target pushes over it is encoded again
# by ratio to fit. The DCI cap (or the HDR Addendum's, with --hdr-dci) still
# applies, so the cap is the smaller of the two, and a 3D encode gives each eye
# half of it.

### KDM email config

`kdm`/`kdm-batch` `--smtp-config` points at a TOML file. It holds the SMTP
password, so keep it outside the repo (e.g. `~/.config/dcpwizard/smtp.toml`,
mode 600). The password is never logged or echoed in errors.

| key | required | notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `host` | yes | SMTP server hostname |
| `port` | yes | e.g. 465 (tls) or 587 (starttls) |
| `security` | no | `tls` (default), `starttls`, or `none` |
| `username` | no | SMTP auth user |
| `password` | no | SMTP auth password |
| `from` | yes | sender address |
| `subject_template` | no | supports `{title}` and `{cinema}` |
| `body_template` | no | supports `{title}` and `{cinema}` |

```toml
host = "smtp.example.com"
port = 587
security = "starttls"
username = "keys@studio.example"
password = "..."
from = "Studio Keys <keys@studio.example>"
subject_template = "KDMs for {title} — {cinema}"
```

With `--cinema`, one email per cinema is sent to its stored contact emails (plus
any `--email-to`), each with that cinema's KDMs zipped. `--email-only-additional`
sends only to `--email-to`.

### TMS upload config

`tms` and `create --upload-to-tms` read a TOML file, by default
`~/.config/dcpwizard/tms.toml` (`--tms-config` points elsewhere). It holds the TMS
password or the key passphrase, so keep it outside the repo, mode 600. Neither is
ever logged, echoed in errors or passed as a command-line argument.

| key | required | notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `protocol` | yes | `sftp` or `ftp` |
| `host` | yes | TMS hostname or IP |
| `port` | no | defaults to 22 for sftp, 21 for ftp |
| `path` | yes | remote directory the package directory is created under |
| `user` | yes | login user |
| `password` | unless `private_key` is set | login password |
| `private_key` | no | sftp only, path to an ssh private key, the password is not sent when it is set |
| `private_key_passphrase` | no | only for an encrypted `private_key` |

```toml
protocol = "sftp"
host = "tms.cinema.example"
path = "/mnt/dcp"
user = "projectionist"
password = "..."
```

Every file of the package is uploaded into `<path>/<package directory name>/`.
An sftp host must be in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`: an unknown or changed host key is
refused rather than handed the password, and the error prints the fingerprint and
the `ssh-keyscan` line that records it once the cinema has confirmed it. Plain
`ftp` sends the login and the package unencrypted, so prefer `sftp` wherever the
TMS offers it, and an ftp config that names a `private_key` is refused.

## REST API

Start the server:
```bash
dcpwizard serve --bind 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Or via Docker:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/media:/data dcpwizard serve --bind 0.0.0.0:8080
```

`--api-key <key>` requires that key in `X-Api-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer` on
every request but `GET /health`, and answers 401 without it. Without the flag the
API is open to anyone who can reach the bind address, so bind to `127.0.0.1` or
put it behind something that authenticates. The key is compared without stopping
at the first differing byte, and a key on the command line is visible to anything
that can read the process list:
```bash
dcpwizard serve --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 --api-key "$(cat /run/secrets/dcpwizard-api-key)"
```

Every job route (`GET /jobs`, `POST /create`, `POST /verify`, `GET /metrics`)
proxies to the job daemon, and answers 503 naming `dcpwizard daemon` when it is
not running.
